**Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning with Python and Logistic Regression Model**

This project aims to develop a heart disease prediction model using logistic regression algorithm in Python. The model uses various machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, to develop an accurate and reliable prediction model for identifying individuals at risk of developing heart disease.

**Getting Started**

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install the following Python packages:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn


**Data**

The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which contains various features such as age, sex, cholesterol level, and blood pressure, and the target variable is a binary indicator of whether or not the individual has heart disease.

The dataset is included in the project repository as a CSV file named heart_disease.csv.

**Usage**

To run the project, open the heart_disease_prediction.ipynb Jupyter notebook and follow the step-by-step instructions. 

**Results**

The final logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 81.97% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting heart disease in individuals at risk.

**Contributing**

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please create an issue on GitHub or submit a pull request.
